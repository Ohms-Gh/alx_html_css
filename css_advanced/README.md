# CSS Advanced Project

## Description

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Program** and builds upon the `HTML, advanced` project. The focus is on implementing **advanced CSS styling** to replicate a professionally designed homepage from a given Figma design.

We use **semantic HTML**, **flexbox**, **grid**, and other CSS techniques to create a responsive and visually appealing layout.

## Objectives

- Recreate a homepage layout as designed in Figma
- Apply advanced CSS techniques to match fonts, spacing, colors, and layout
- Maintain accessibility and responsiveness across devices
- Use existing HTML structure provided by ALX (unaltered)

## Files Included

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure provided by ALX
- `styles.css`: Your custom CSS file for styling
- `base.css`: Provided by ALX for default base styling
- `images/`: All image assets used in the layout
